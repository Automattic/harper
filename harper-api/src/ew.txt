Okay, everyone, lets plan this party. The first thing to do is setup a budget. We need to decide on food, drinks and decorations. I've found a good caterer, and also we should book a DJ. The venue is available on Saturday, so we should move quick. I can't find the invitation list any where, so I'll have to make a new one. This is a big event, and I want it to be perfect. Your going to have a geat time, I promise. There are less days left than I thought, so we can't postpone our decisions any further. Its going to be a night to remember.
