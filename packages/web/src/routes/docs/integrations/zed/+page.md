[Zed](https://zed.dev) is a new editor from the folks who made [Atom](https://atom-editor.cc/).
It has a host of attractive features that align quite well with Harper's mission (including lightning-fast startup and responsiveness).

The best part: thanks to the wonderful work of community contributors, Harper has support for it!
To get started, follow the instructions over on the [Zed plugin's README](https://github.com/Stef16Robbe/harper_zed).
Once installed, it will automatically download and run [`harper-ls`](/docs/integrations/language-server).
