title: Harper for WordPress

<script>
    import {Button} from "flowbite-svelte"

Harper still works great with WordPress, but the recommended way to use it today is the
[Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/private-grammar-checking/lodbfhdipoipcjmlebjbgmmgekckhpfb).<br/>
Read the announcement: [The Chrome Extension Supersedes the WordPress Plugin](https://elijahpotter.dev/articles/the_chrome_extension_supersedes_the_wordpress_plugin).

The extension is faster to iterate on than the WordPress.com plugin review process, which means you get new
features and fixes right away. It also offers a more holistic experience by keeping your Harper preferences in
sync across the sites where you write.

## Still using the plugin?

The existing Harper WordPress plugin will stick around, but it no longer receives regular updates and is already a
few months behind the Chrome extension. If you need a manual copy, you can still download `harper.zip` from
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/Automattic/harper/releases/latest) and upload it to your site.
